LG Esteem - Homeless Kernel
By: Kanaida

A Kernel that greatly extends battery life on the LG Esteem.
It's based on the LG's ver B firmware.

Scripts:
build_kernel.sh
	Sets up build environment, 
	Runs kernel configuration, 
	then builds after changes are made.

build_kernel_default.sh
	Sets up build environment, 
	resets kernel config to LG's B firmware defaults, 
	then builds after changes are made.

clean_kernel.sh
	Sets up build environment
	Does a Make clean on the kernel

Compiled Output lands here:
LG-Esteem-Homeless-Kernel/kernel/arch/arm/boot

Stuff included:
android SDK tools + LG Source code + My modded configs
GNU GPL something other other, there's the source :) lol
